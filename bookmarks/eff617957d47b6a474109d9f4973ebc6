    "extended": "My 4 week old has been nursing constantly for the past week or week and a half. I know that babies will nurse often during growth spurts & illness & they will cluster feed. I have no problem spending the time nursing her. I have committed to doing it for at least 6 months, but I am concerned because she seems to be spitting up a lot. Projectile spit up at times even, and I feel like it may be because she is getting so full. I burp her often but it is also very difficult to get a burp out of",
